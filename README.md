Multi-passphrase multi-content in a single encrypted file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This tool is just a proof of concept, I made it only to satisfy my curiosity and learn more about the Rust programming language.

Using this could result in **serious data loss**. See "problems" on "how does it work" to understand more (I did this in two days heh).

## üå± Demo

```c++
// TODO: add video
```

## Requirements

- GPG (to actually encrypt/decrypt)
- xxd (to transform to hexadecimal)
- qrencode (to generate qr)
- zbar (to decode qr)
- convert (to get PDF from qr)

## üîß How does it work?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124709666/218283119-188016c3-b65b-41bb-ab35-2be97e742819.png)

Each file gets encrypted on its own using the `gpg` command, then a separator string of bytes is added at the end, and appended to the `.hexa` file.

When decrypting, the program parses the binary to partition it by this separator string of bytes, then writes each chunk to a file (restoring the encrypted file). Once all encrypted files are created, it tried to decrypt them one by one, as soon as it finds one it can decrypt, then that's the one it generates.

### Problems:

1. The separator string could appear as part of the output of the encryption algorithm, this would effectively break the program.
2. There's no support for using the same passphrase for multiple files, one would get "lost"
